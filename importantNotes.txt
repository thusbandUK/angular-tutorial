1) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50843655/angular-6-failing-to-load-images-from-assets

Suggested that below (at time of writing what is in angular.json file for "assets") should be replaced with "src/assets"; 
Initially appeared not to work, but then suddenly it seemed that it was indeed the correct solution
// {
              //  "glob": "**/*",
               // "input": "public"
              //}

              
               {
                "glob": "**/*",
                "input": "public"
              }  


**INCORRECT SOLUTION**

0.5) Code if needed:

<img class="brand-logo" src="assets/chopstickMolymod.png" alt="logo" aria-hidden="true" />
  <img src="/assets/img.jpg" alt="">

1) Location of assets folder (for images etc)

https://angular.dev/reference/configs/file-structure#workspace-configuration-files

section: "public"

Docs explain that assets folder should be located in public (for later versions) rather than src (as per previous versions)
