1) On the last page the tutorial introduced async http calls

https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app/14-http

This involved creating a mock database, which was interesting in itself, because it generated a json object at a local port, 
which the front end app then call on as if it was a database.

In the process it called what had previously been template literals as strings, meaning that the DOM was just receiving
image src strings like this: "${this.baseUrl}[rest of string]" which didn't work

in the home.component.ts constructor, I hacked in the following solution:

housingLocationList.forEach((x=>{        
        return x.photo = x.photo.replace("${this.baseUrl}", this.baseUrl);
      }));

(Where baseUrl was defined above the constructor in the home.component.ts export Class)

2) css variables

Didn't manage to fix this. Fora threads suggest that Angular needs to be configured to accept css variables

Just went through the css and subbed in the hex codes, to make the search button appear


3) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50843655/angular-6-failing-to-load-images-from-assets

Suggested that below (at time of writing what is in angular.json file for "assets") should be replaced with "src/assets"; 
Initially appeared not to work, but then suddenly it seemed that it was indeed the correct solution
// {
              //  "glob": "**/*",
               // "input": "public"
              //}

              
               {
                "glob": "**/*",
                "input": "public"
              }  


**INCORRECT SOLUTION**

0.5) Code if needed:

<img class="brand-logo" src="assets/chopstickMolymod.png" alt="logo" aria-hidden="true" />
  <img src="/assets/img.jpg" alt="">

1) Location of assets folder (for images etc)

https://angular.dev/reference/configs/file-structure#workspace-configuration-files

section: "public"

Docs explain that assets folder should be located in public (for later versions) rather than src (as per previous versions)


2) Previous attempts to fix problem

Suggested that below (at time of writing what is in angular.json file for "assets") should be replaced with "src/assets";

               {
                "glob": "**/*",
                "input": "public"
